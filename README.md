## Project Structure

Inside the project, you'll find the `App.js` file, which contains a simple React component. It renders a `<div>` element with an empty `<h1>` heading and a `<p>` paragraph. This component serves as a starting point for your experiments and further learning in React.

Feel free to navigate through the other files, such as `index.js`, `style.css`, and `package.json`. These files offer additional configurations and styling options that enhance your understanding of the React Starter project.
